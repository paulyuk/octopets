For the incidents that are related to app down with 500 errors, please do following step by step-
- Check activity logs for deployments and draw area chart correlation of 500 errors and deployment times
- Also look at exceptions in azure monitor
- You must show me chart of 500 errors before mitigation and chart of 500 errors vs deployment activity correlation (don’t skip this), check last 15 mins of metrics to validate this
- Give me updates of your actions at every step
- Based on these, limit yourself to these mitigations only and perform the action autonomously
- If this issue is caused due to a bad deployment then Revert to previous healthy deployment. After you roll back, just give it few seconds to check the roll back status by checking the request metrics
